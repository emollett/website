It has come up a few times in discussions I’ve had about good practice on delivery teams, and there still seems to be reluctance to champion it, or even embrace it. Sometimes this comes from the delivery manager themselves, but more often from a general feeling that their organisation won't accept it. I’ve had on one occasion a delivery manager tell me that pairing is something that can’t be done in government. With a better understanding of how to support pairing, delivery managers might feel more confident in advocating for their team."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/prioritising-as-a-team/","categorySlug":"/categories/delivery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Prioritising as a team","date":"2019-03-16","category":"Delivery","description":"Your whole team should be involved in prioritisation of their work.

These are all enabled by having service teams that support a coherent set of services for their full life. Funding teams is a necessity to be able to provide this model."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/radarban-roadmap/","categorySlug":"/categories/product-management/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Radarban Roadmap","date":"2018-10-10","category":"Product Management","description":"The roadmaps I’ve seen before have tended to be linear, and have dates. This is the entire point in a roadmap for some people, but for me it is too restrictive if I am meant to be able to respond to changes and new priorities. Once you have a linear roadmap, people expect it to be followed and for things to turn up in exactly that order. This is even worse if there are dates on it, because they expect those things at exactly those times. (Again, this is probably why some people like them, but it doesn’t work if you are responding to what you are learning)."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/balancing-long-term-vision/","categorySlug":"/categories/delivery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Balancing long term vision with short term delivery priorities","date":"2018-05-02","category":"Delivery","description":"I’ve been thinking recently about how our team balances the effort we put in to putting together designs for the long term vision for our service, with the work we need to do now to deliver our minimum viable product and the private beta of our service."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Product Management"}}
