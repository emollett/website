It has come up a few times in discussions I’ve had about good practice on delivery teams, and there still seems to be reluctance to champion it, or even embrace it. Sometimes this comes from the delivery manager themselves, but more often from a general feeling that their organisation won't accept it. I’ve had on one occasion a delivery manager tell me that pairing is something that can’t be done in government. With a better understanding of how to support pairing, delivery managers might feel more confident in advocating for their team."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/new-personal-site/","categorySlug":"/categories/blogging/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Trying out gatsbyjs for a personal site","date":"2019-02-02","category":"Blogging","description":"I've decided to create my own personal site, to keep my blog posts and personal projects together in one place.

I am a delivery manager and don’t often get the chance to code day to day, so have set it as my learning and development objective. Once I had it written, I decided that learning to deploy something would be a good next step, as before I have just used github pages. A while ago a colleague recommended to me that when I was learning something new I write a blog post about it. It would help me remember and think through what I did, ensure that I fully understood what I had learned, and might help someone else trying to do the same thing."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/donald-rumsfeld-estimating/","categorySlug":"/categories/delivery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Donald Rumsfeld estimating","date":"2018-05-09","category":"Delivery","description":"For a long time, I have avoided estimation. I’ve generally found that story count and cycle time has served me well enough if I do need to provide forecasts, and I have only provided ‘how long might this particular feature take’ forecasts, rather than “when will I get all of this” forecasts of large numbers of features."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/balancing-long-term-vision/","categorySlug":"/categories/delivery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Balancing long term vision with short term delivery priorities","date":"2018-05-02","category":"Delivery","description":"I’ve been thinking recently about how our team balances the effort we put in to putting together designs for the long term vision for our service, with the work we need to do now to deliver our minimum viable product and the private beta of our service."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/types-of-work/","categorySlug":"/categories/delivery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Types of work on our kanban board","date":"2017-07-20","category":"Delivery","description":"One of the things that often gets discussed during our daily team stand up is whether a piece of work should be on our kanban board, and whether the work on the board accurately reflects what the team is working on. To get the most out of kanban, we should be reflecting all the work the team is doing on the board so that we can ensure that the work in progress limits are having the right impact, and improving the flow of delivery."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Development"}}
