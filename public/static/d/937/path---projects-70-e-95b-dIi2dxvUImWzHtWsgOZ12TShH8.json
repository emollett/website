Coffee is input with info about who bought it and when, when it was opened, and if people particularly liked it. The site ranks who on the team has bought the most coffee, and tracks how many packs we open each month. This was my first react project, and first project trying to deploy something myself.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/emollett/coffee-tracker\">Github project</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://coffee-tracker.eleanormollett.com/\">Coffee Tracker</a></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://emollett.github.io/meeting-value/index\">Meeting Calculator</a></h2>\n<p>This calculates the cost of a meeting by multiplying the average day rate of the attendees by the number of them present.</p>\n<p>The timer can be paused and reset, and if you need to hide the day rate, check the button after entering the information. Checking the box can be done before or after the timer starts, the day rate information can be seen again by clicking the check-box again.</p>\n<p>I created this after sitting in several very large very long meetings wondering how much it was all costing us. At the time I was doing code practice on codewars, but hadn’t quite worked out how the code I was writing there translated to something I could see and interact with, so I created this to test out what I had learned.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/emollett/meeting-value\">Github project</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://emollett.github.io/meeting-value/index\">Meeting Calculator</a></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://emollett.github.io/calendar/calendar\">Calendar Creator</a></h2>\n<p>A very basic site for generating blank calendars to use in planning - you can choose the start date, how many weeks you want, and if you want weekends or not.
