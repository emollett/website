It has come up a few times in discussions I’ve had about good practice on delivery teams, and there still seems to be reluctance to champion it, or even embrace it. Sometimes this comes from the delivery manager themselves, but more often from a general feeling that their organisation won't accept it. I’ve had on one occasion a delivery manager tell me that pairing is something that can’t be done in government. With a better understanding of how to support pairing, delivery managers might feel more confident in advocating for their team."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/prioritising-as-a-team/","categorySlug":"/categories/delivery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Prioritising as a team","date":"2019-03-16","category":"Delivery","description":"Your whole team should be involved in prioritisation of their work.

These are all enabled by having service teams that support a coherent set of services for their full life. Funding teams is a necessity to be able to provide this model."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/new-personal-site/","categorySlug":"/categories/blogging/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Trying out gatsbyjs for a personal site","date":"2019-02-02","category":"Blogging","description":"I've decided to create my own personal site, to keep my blog posts and personal projects together in one place.

I am a delivery manager and don’t often get the chance to code day to day, so have set it as my learning and development objective. Once I had it written, I decided that learning to deploy something would be a good next step, as before I have just used github pages. A while ago a colleague recommended to me that when I was learning something new I write a blog post about it. It would help me remember and think through what I did, ensure that I fully understood what I had learned, and might help someone else trying to do the same thing."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/radarban-roadmap/","categorySlug":"/categories/product-management/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Radarban Roadmap","date":"2018-10-10","category":"Product Management","description":"The roadmaps I’ve seen before have tended to be linear, and have dates. This is the entire point in a roadmap for some people, but for me it is too restrictive if I am meant to be able to respond to changes and new priorities. Once you have a linear roadmap, people expect it to be followed and for things to turn up in exactly that order. This is even worse if there are dates on it, because they expect those things at exactly those times. (Again, this is probably why some people like them, but it doesn’t work if you are responding to what you are learning)."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/donald-rumsfeld-estimating/","categorySlug":"/categories/delivery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Donald Rumsfeld estimating","date":"2018-05-09","category":"Delivery","description":"For a long time, I have avoided estimation. I’ve generally found that story count and cycle time has served me well enough if I do need to provide forecasts, and I have only provided ‘how long might this particular feature take’ forecasts, rather than “when will I get all of this” forecasts of large numbers of features."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/balancing-long-term-vision/","categorySlug":"/categories/delivery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Balancing long term vision with short term delivery priorities","date":"2018-05-02","category":"Delivery","description":"I’ve been thinking recently about how our team balances the effort we put in to putting together designs for the long term vision for our service, with the work we need to do now to deliver our minimum viable product and the private beta of our service."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/reducing-time-in-queues/","categorySlug":"/categories/delivery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reducing time spent in queues","date":"2017-07-26","category":"Delivery","description":"Many teams across DWP and government are now using kanban boards to visualise the work going on in their team. However, this is only one part of kanban. Whilst it is an important first stage to map out the flow work takes to delivery, and to visualise what work the team has going on, the main value of kanban comes in using it to then improve the flow of your work. The way kanban does this is through limiting work in progress. It is the most important aspect of kanban, but it is often neglected."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/types-of-work/","categorySlug":"/categories/delivery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Types of work on our kanban board","date":"2017-07-20","category":"Delivery","description":"One of the things that often gets discussed during our daily team stand up is whether a piece of work should be on our kanban board, and whether the work on the board accurately reflects what the team is working on.
