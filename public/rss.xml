To help me remember what I‚Äôve learned, I plan on writing what I did each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much better day today, things worked!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;DAY 4&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left yesterday knowing the CodeDeploy was deploying my files to my EC2 instance, but that the deployments were still failing to then follow the appspec instructions. I had been following &lt;a href=&quot;https://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2016-12-26-autodeploy-from-github-using-aws-codedeploy/&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; and using their examples of the appspec file and the before and after install hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With fresher eyes, it didn‚Äôt take too long to notice that the issues I was having were due to using a .sh file extension on the hooks where the example wasn‚Äôt, and not updating the location, and also not noticing that the location and the name of the after install hook in the examples differ. Correcting these fixed all the issues I was having. My final appspec file and hooks can be seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emollett/meeting-value/blob/master/appspec.yml&quot;&gt;here for the appspec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emollett/meeting-value/tree/master/scripts&quot;&gt;here for the hooks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I was able to deploy simple pages, I wanted to give it a go with a more complex deployment - a MERN stack app I‚Äôve been working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really struggled with the file paths for this one, it is a more complex application structure, with some oddities due to how I set it up (which I really should refactor). If you &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emollett/coffee-tracker/issues/26&quot;&gt;look at my commits&lt;/a&gt;, you can see how many changes I made to file paths!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I finally got that all working, the deployments were working all fine - when I push to github, it now kicks off a build and deploys it without me having to intervene. Next up is scripting the set up of the environment, as despite setting up a template for the environment, I came across quite a lot that I had to install or config that I had to change by hand which I want to have in code (this also highlighted my lax documentation as there was a fair bit that I had forgotten that needed installing, which I also need to improve).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spike week day 3]]></title><description><![CDATA[We are currently having one of our quarterly spike weeks on our team, and for once I am managing to protect my own time and do my own spike.

To help me remember what I‚Äôve learned, I plan on writing what I did each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After yesterday‚Äôs disaster I wasn‚Äôt sure about writing anything today as I haven‚Äôt really got much further in terms of outputs. I have learned things though, so in the interest of sharing that here is what I was up to today and learned&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;DAY 3&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having managed to get the codedeploy agent installed on Tuesday, I spent yesterday failing to deploy anything. It took the whole day to realise I was missing the appspec file from my application, so I did actually learn something yesterday was but was too frustrated to recognise it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I set to adding an example appspec file to a very basic application and trying to deploy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued to get the incredibly useful error message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe overall deployment failed because too many individual instances failed deployment, too few healthy instances are available for deployment, or some instances in your deployment group are experiencing problems.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after some googling I‚Äôve found where I can find more useful logs in my EC2 instance, and this is my learning for today. These are the logs I‚Äôve found useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/var/log/aws/codedeploy-agent/codedeploy-agent.log&lt;/code&gt;
Gave me an initial reassurance that the agent was running and doing something, also that I had an issue with my appspec file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root/deployment-logs/codedeploy-agent-deployments.log&lt;/code&gt;
These are the logs for the deployments themselves and at what stage they failed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root/deployment-group-ID/&lt;/code&gt;
Looking in here I could see my deployments by deployment ID, confirming that the codedeploy agent was getting somewhere, and I could see that my files had copied across ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root/deployment-group-ID/deployment-ID/logs/scripts.log&lt;/code&gt;
In each deployment, you can also get logs for the scripts you are running, which gives you a good idea of which one is failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These have helped me identify that codedeploy is at least fetching my files from github and sticking them on the EC2 instance. It is also now able to recognise the appspec file (after a false start with a misspelled file extension üò∂). Currently, it is failing with the predeploy script, but I feel much better than yesterday as I can at least see where things are going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roll on the final day!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spike week day 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[We are currently having one of our quarterly spike weeks on our team, and for once I am managing to protect my own time and do my own spike.

To help me remember what I‚Äôve learned, I plan on writing what I did each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Day 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our theme this time is infrastructure, and I‚Äôve decided to automate my deployment pipeline. To do this I want to set up so that I can spin up new EC2 instances each time I deploy, and use AWS CodeDeploy to deploy to them. Currently I have a pipeline set up that sets off a build when I push to master in github, but I still need to ssh into my EC2 instance to pull down the build artifact from an S3 bucket. I wrote about how I initially set it up &lt;a href=&quot;http://eleanormollett.com/posts/What-I-learned-deploying&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and it has moved on a little since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan was to set up an EC2 template which would have all my current parameters like the AMI I am using, the security groups I have set up etc defined to make it easy to reproduce each time I launch a new instance. This part was very straightforward, it was simply a case of working through the options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started hitting issues when I went to configure it to install the CodeDeploy agent on start up. I was following the instructions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/instances-ec2-create.html&quot;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;, but when I went in to check the CodeDeploy service was running, it wasn‚Äôt. I went through a few times, checking the variables I was entering, trying out some variations I found in other tutorials. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I decided to launch an instance without the User Data instructions for launching the CodeDeploy agent and running them myself after the instance had launched. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this was incredibly frustrating, at least it reassured me that it should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the instructions I used from the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install ruby
apt-get -y install wget
cd /home/ubuntu
wget https://aws-codedeploy-eu-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install
chmod +x ./install
./install auto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don‚Äôt really get much indication about what is going wrong, so after several attempts to use the logs from the console which only occasionally showed me anything useful, I followed the instructions &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-log-user-data/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to give me some logging data, and added some console logs to help me orientate myself, leaving me with the following instructions in the User Data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash -xe
exec &amp;gt; &amp;gt;(tee /var/log/user-data.log|logger -t user-data -s 2&amp;gt;/dev/console) 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
echo &amp;quot;FIRST HELLO&amp;quot;
apt-get -y update
echo &amp;quot;hello after update&amp;quot;
apt-get -y install ruby
echo &amp;quot;hello after installing ruby&amp;quot;
apt-get -y install wget
echo &amp;quot;hello after installing wget&amp;quot;
cd /home/ubuntu
wget https://aws-codedeploy-eu-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install
echo &amp;quot;hello after getting the installer&amp;quot;
chmod +x ./install
./install auto
echo &amp;quot;hello at the end&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This narrowed down the issue to the step where we install ruby. It was at this point I remembered with sinking horror that there had in fact been a prompt when I had run through line my line myself where I had had to select yes to continue. I hadn‚Äôt taken much notice of it at the time, assuming that the -y command would skip through all of those. A bit more googling led me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/146283/how-to-prevent-prompt-that-ask-to-restart-services-when-installing-libpq-dev&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; which is exactly what I had happily tabbed through when doing it by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the suggestion to add &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive&lt;/code&gt; worked, giving me the following instructions to run on launch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install ruby
apt-get -y install wget
cd /home/ubuntu
wget https://aws-codedeploy-eu-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install
chmod +x ./install
./install auto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea why this isn‚Äôt in the instructions AWS provides. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt always run like that? Anyway, what I‚Äôve learned today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a way to read the logs asap if it isn‚Äôt already there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take more notice of what I‚Äôm doing differently when I run through something step by step&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything seems so easy afterwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[More on roadmaps]]></title><description><![CDATA[I've been thinking more about roadmaps recently and how they differ from delivery plans. - written up from a twitter thread]]></description><link>https://eleanormollett.com/posts/more-on-roadmaps/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://eleanormollett.com/posts/more-on-roadmaps/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;written up from a twitter thread found &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EleanorMollett/status/1143818859134234624&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been thinking more about roadmaps recently and how they differ from delivery plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might be being too literal, but to me a road map show clearly where you want to get to, shows the paths (multiple!) to get there, and the places you pass through on the way. If something blocks you, you can use it to reorientate yourself and continue on route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A road map of Manchester&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most roadmaps I see look more like roads - they have a single path, give no room for different routes. They don‚Äôt support a conversation of how to get there, or why you are taking that route. You can‚Äôt always see how the path supports the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these are delivery plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They set out what you are delivering and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They lead to useful conversations, and help communicate delivery and dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting them together helps you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don‚Äôt always effectively communicate your end goal, and they don‚Äôt usually help you make decisions or change direction part way through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://eleanormollett.com/posts/radarban-roadmap/&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; about using radar style roadmaps - I think this sits between a delivery plan and a delivery roadmap. It can change, it supports decision making, but it fails to show the end goal, or link any of the deliverables to our goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve recently been working with our infrastructure team on a roadmap to communicate all the things they want to do to make life easier for devs and improve our infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started listing out deliverables, and mapping out everything we might do to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of routes to several of them, so we captured that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became clear quickly that there were some clear goals the team had, and we could link to those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where we‚Äôve ended up is a big network of things we can do to achieve our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A rough sketch of how activities link to our goals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We labelled the links with what impact doing one node has on the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That helps us when explaining why we need to do some of the foundational work. That now clearly links to a goal, even if you have to traverse several subsequent nodes to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives you no information at all about delivery. But it‚Äôs already kicked off discussions about what we can start, and who can help us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early days, but hopefully it will be useful, and is another alternative to delivery plans masquerading as roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to support pairing]]></title><description><![CDATA[This post is about how delivery managers (and product managers) can encourage and supporting pairing.

It has come up a few times in discussions I‚Äôve had about good practice on delivery teams, and there still seems to be reluctance to champion it, or even embrace it. Sometimes this comes from the delivery manager themselves, but more often from a general feeling that their organisation won‚Äôt accept it. I‚Äôve had on one occasion a delivery manager tell me that pairing is something that can‚Äôt be done in government. With a better understanding of how to support pairing, delivery managers might feel more confident in advocating for their team. At the end of the day advocating for best practice and working to ensure teams have the space and support to do this is what our jobs as delivery managers are about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, pairing is about two (or more!) developers working together on the same piece of code at the same time. It can take several forms, but often one will write the code whilst the other reviews what they are writing as they write it. They should regularly switch who is taking which role.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    
&lt;em&gt;Two developers pairing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several benefits to pairing in software development. You increase code quality due to the extra pair of eyes, and because you put in more thought if you are having to explain what you are doing as you go along. Pairing can also help on teams where you are getting people up to speed with a code base. It can also help reduce the ‚Äúbus factor‚Äù problem, where either entire codebases or specific bits of functionality are only understood by one developer, leading to major issues when they leave your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as the benefits to the code you are delivering, there are benefits to your team. Pairing helps developers learn and share techniques, as people won‚Äôt all have the same approach to tackling problems. Considering and discussing several approaches rather than jumping straight in with the first approach can also improve quality. Pairing can also help strengthen teams, particularly if people tend to work independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a delivery manager there are several things you can be doing to encourage and support pairing on your team. The first is to actively discuss it with your team, and make it clear that it is something that you support. This is particularly important if you are working in an environment where people feel high pressure to churn through work. In this case they may not feel comfortable instigating pairing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowering work in progress limits can also help, if supported by a message that you expect the lower limit to be achieved by people pairing. It can encourage a discussion each stand up where developers who can‚Äôt pick up a new card due to the work in progress limit can ask who is open to pairing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once pairing is common on your teams, there are several things you can encourage. Keep an eye on whether people are varying who they pair with, to keep the benefit of exposure to different ways of working. If there is a big variation in seniority, make sure the more senior developer isn‚Äôt always taking the lead, and that the less senior developer feels supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all its benefits, pairing is very tiring for many people. Don‚Äôt get over enthusiastic about encouraging it all the time, as people do need a break. At the end of the day, you are there to support and encourage, but not control the process ‚Äì provide what the developers need to organise themselves. Check in regularly about how it is going, and revisit it in retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also practical ways to support pairing. If you don‚Äôt have the space at your workstations, and dual monitors, that is going to make pairing much harder. Some people have an extra set of keyboards and mice, make this possible if it is what your developers are asking for. If your team is remote, there are options around for remote pairing ‚Äì my team have used the tools in VS code, which seem to work pretty well for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another blocker to pairing can be organisational metrics. If you track time people are working on things, if only one person is attributed to a card, or if you track commits, and these metrics have an impact on people, they will be discouraged from doing anything that might impact these. The obvious answer here is that you absolutely should not be using metrics like these. This is probably another blog post, but metrics like these are being used push back against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, once your team is pairing, keep expanding it! Mobbing can be a way for the entire team to tackle a tricky problem. Start encouraging pairing between different disciplines, not just developers. We have had some really good success pairing developers with user researchers particularly with accessibility research, with designers to better understand what is possible, and with testers on improving automation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Prioritising as a team]]></title><description><![CDATA[Your whole team should be involved in prioritisation of their work. Providing their knowledge as input directly, and empowering them to decide on their own work produces better software and better teams]]></description><link>https://eleanormollett.com/posts/prioritising-as-a-team/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://eleanormollett.com/posts/prioritising-as-a-team/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve worked on several teams where the sole person involved in prioritising the backlog of work is the product owner. I‚Äôve found this to be unhealthy for the team, leading to feelings of distance from the work and of being in a feature factory where you just get fed cards. I think this has stemmed from scrum, and the definition of a product owner including&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet whilst the product owner is accountable and responsible for this, it does not and should not mean that they are the only person involved in prioritising the backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the product owner is a product manager acting in the role to represent many stakeholders, or a direct customer/stakeholder product owner, they will not have all the knowledge necessary to prioritise all the work required to release usable software. To prioritise well they will need to listen to user researchers, designers, developers, and the rest of their team. Prioritising as a team provides this, and gives the team more of a buy in to the work they are doing and better context to decision making.  The product owner can keep the tie breaking vote, but everyone on the team will understand why and how the work has been prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you might be thinking does this mean decision making by committee. It shouldn‚Äôt. The people involved should be those who have direct knowledge of the factors that will affect prioritisation. Whilst they may have opinions they express and challenge about other areas; the team should respect each other‚Äôs opinions enough to allow the right people to have the right level of influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key factor will be the criteria for prioritisation. This is something that the product owner needs to communicate to the team so that the team can use that to inform their recommendations. Making this clear in the method you are using for prioritising is essential so that everyone understands the reason for decisions and doesn‚Äôt feel disempowered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/types-of-work/&quot;&gt;one of my first blogs&lt;/a&gt; about types of work the team works on, one of which was tech work. In that post, I discussed ring fencing 20% of the backlog for this work to ensure that the work needed to ensure security and stability were prioritised. This was due to the backlog the team I worked on being the domain of the product owner and mainly feature focused. By prioritising as a team, tech work can be prioritised in context and understood by the whole team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally use a similar method to the one I discussed and illustrated there to prioritise as a team when we need to prioritise a large amount of work. We draw out two axes with the main criteria for prioritisation on them, and then place each card on the board, discussing their relative positions to the cards around them. Almost always one of the axes is time, as there will always be some element of external deadlines, or of internal dependencies. The other axis will be some variation of importance, with what is important to us made clear. Most of the time it is value to our users, but I have worked on a project where the axis was ‚Äòknowledge transfer required. This was where we had a short period of access to consultants and wanted to prioritise work we needed help with over work that might be important to our users but we knew we could handle on our own once they left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Part of the team I am on standing around a board discussing the prioritisation of their work to be done&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method works well if there is a large amount of work to prioritise, as it helps to visualise it, allowing the whole team to see all the cards at once. If we have a much smaller amount of work to prioritise (eg higher level features for a roadmap, or just the work to implement one feature), we tend to simply chuck them up as a list and discuss their prioritisation. I try to keep the number of cards with an explicit prioritisation low, so that we don‚Äôt spend more time than we need prioritising things that will change in the future as we learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Involving the team in prioritisation empowers them, involving them in decisions about the work they do. This is essential if you want to have self-organising teams. It is not enough to empower teams to organise how they do the work, they need to be able to influence the work they are doing. Your team will have the best knowledge of their users, the tech they are using, and their dependencies, and so need to be able to feed this into decision making. If they don‚Äôt have this knowledge, you have much deeper problems that need addressing.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Funding service teams rather than projects]]></title><description><![CDATA[Part 2 of service teams rather than project teams, this time with the practicalities of how to govern their spend]]></description><link>https://eleanormollett.com/posts/funding-service-teams/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://eleanormollett.com/posts/funding-service-teams/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Project funding is often used as a proxy for governance. Funding work as projects theoretically makes governance more straightforward as you track spend against a set business case.  Given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/19/lets-fund-teams-not-projects/&quot;&gt;issues with this approach&lt;/a&gt; with digital projects, there is clearly an argument for rethinking how we govern digital spend. Funding teams rather than projects is often discussed, and I currently work somewhere close to that approach. Here I outline the governance we use for our teams‚Äô spend. I‚Äôve written previously on the benefits I‚Äôve seen as a delivery manager for the team, so this is more an outline of what governance we use to achieve that. This isn‚Äôt exhaustive, and is only an outline of our model as everywhere has its own peculiarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is the total amount that the organisation is willing to spend on digital. There will be various ways to determine this number including previous spend and projections. At the end of the day though, this determines the size of your team, and how much you can deliver. Once these people exist, you should be prioritising what they work on, rather than applying for headcount for projects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    
&lt;em&gt;The organisation decides where its priorities are, and provides part of its budget to support digital services in the organisation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the organisation decides what its priorities are. There are a couple of ways of doing this, but grouping services that align to areas of business value enables the next level of prioritisation. The organisation decides the priority of each service group, and assigns a proportion of the budget. They also decide what they want the split of new build to live service support to be. A delivery team aligns to these services, and users of the services govern the service group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We revisit this split quarterly. This is to ensure that the split still aligns to current priorities, and if the work done over the quarter has actually reflected the split. The flexibility of the teams means there may be variation if there have been lots of live service issues or change requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The organisation decides where its priorities are within digital between different service groups, and funds the delivery teams accordingly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the members of the service group communicate the priority of the services the delivery team look after. This helps with deciding which change requests to accept, what level of support to give defects for different services, and which new builds take priority. We review this monthly, checking if the work still aligns to the priorities, questioning if it doesn‚Äôt, and communicating if the priorities need changing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    
&lt;em&gt;The organisation decides how much to spend on supporting live services against building new ones. Prioritising services against each other is done by the service group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communication of changing priorities can go both ways. The service group contains users of the services who communicate their priorities. The delivery team raise anything they have uncovered doing user research or analysing live service issues. The team also feedback on the complexity of the work, and what impacts it might have. I‚Äôve found this is particularly useful when prioritising change requests. Having users of different services discuss these together with the delivery team demonstrates the effect prioritisation will have on the delivery of other work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governance groups at both levels also act as a check that value is being realised. They agree and challenge budgets for new builds based on business cases, which act as upper limits for spend on that particular work. They can also provide challenge and support for benefits realisation. This model where governance acts as the critical friend to delivery, rather than a top down inquisitor is incredibly helpful in improving communication and gaining traction for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do still have some challenges, and improvements to make. For me the main challenge is continuing to move the thinking from prioritising work to prioritising problems. Currently the delivery team has a lot of power to suggest different approaches and teams are coming around to articulating problems they want solved, but we still have some way to go. If the prioritisation at every level was on the basis of which organisational problems have the most priority, I would be pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Being on a service team rather than a project team]]></title><description><![CDATA[The benefits for me of having a service team rather than project teams are team stability, the service stability, and the long-term strategy it enables at the team level.

I had a discussion at a session on funding projects rather than teams at the last DeliverCon and was asked to write up some of what I was talking about. Every time I‚Äôve tried to write this it hasn‚Äôt come out quite how I wanted, which I think is because the benefits for me are less around the funding, so focusing on that wasn‚Äôt working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my current team we support a range of services that support our organisation in ensuring that the guidance we produce is influenced by the people who it will affect, and that we reflect their needs and priorities in the guidance that will affect them. What this means is we are supporting 5 live services (one of which was recently migrated to us, outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@james.kirk84/a-tale-of-two-teams-c64c11d8c789&quot;&gt;this fantastic post by James&lt;/a&gt;, and actually comprises of 16 deployable systems), two projects in the private beta stage, one project in public beta, one project delivered by an external partner, and a discovery to look at whether one of the live services is still meeting user needs. There are two other teams in Digital Services that look after a similar mix of services but with different missions and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound completely unmanageable, but actually provides several benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Team stability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stability of the team is improved because we always have work ‚Äì when you are between projects, or when you don‚Äôt have approval to start, you still exist as a team and have things to work on. This is because the team covers a group of services at various stages from build to live support. When we are between new builds, we are working on improving our live services, or responding to live service requests. I no longer have the issue of trying to work out what a team will be doing when there is no approval to proceed with a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I remember from project led funding is working with large spreadsheets to try and work out if the team had enough funding to keep us together. I was constantly working out how much project funding we had, and when it would kick in, and trying to ensure it lined up to keep the team together. With team led funding, the team has funding all the way though, and I can assign costs to projects as we go along. I may need to keep within a certain budget for projects, but the team as a whole has funding and can keep working. I also don‚Äôt have the headache of different parts of the business funding bits and pieces of projects and having to go back and forth between different funding governance to scrape together all the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prioritisation of work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teams are also able to prioritise their work better. As each covers several services, we can prioritise them against each other, and provide the right amount of support. Low priority services don‚Äôt need permanent assignment of people, and there are fewer issues with varying the amount spent over the year depending on the immediate priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The services a team looks after tend to support the same stakeholder group. This means that when it comes to prioritisation, there is a direct impact on those users of prioritising one piece of work over another. The same people will deliver each item, so prioritising one item over another has a real impact on delivery ‚Äì this means the prioritisation conversations are more real, and the less valuable work will actually get deprioritised. When you have teams with a single project, you might prioritise within the team, but there less visibility of prioritisation of what work different teams are doing against each other. This in effect ring fences funding for low priority work, rather than looking at it against another piece of work and deciding which is more important.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    
&lt;em&gt;By prioritising the work as one service team looking after multiple services rather than at the project level, it becomes obvious that the work that Team A would have been doing isn‚Äôt actually that high value. We get to focus instead on delivering higher value work first&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Service stability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our teams all support a mix of live services and new builds. This means they are likely to be the same team supporting new builds once they go live. This gives teams a real stake in the technical decisions they make and encourages consideration of how to support services . This has an impact not just on the technical and architectural decisions made when designing solutions, but also on the quality of the work . We can‚Äôt defer bugs or documentation onto someone else, we know that they will come back to bite us when we are running the service in live. Once a service is in live, we also have the team who best understands the service looking after it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bus factor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work hard to try to ensure the team has a low bus factor ‚Äì we never want to be in a situation where we have replicated project teams on the individual level. We ensure that people rotate around doing live service and project work, and that all the team members have experience on all the services we support. We benefit from people getting a good range of technical experience, and from not relying on a single source of knowledge that could leave. If people are looking for more experience in a particular area, it is likely that we will have something we can provide them with to support that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long term strategy at the team level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have found that we can have much longer-term strategic discussions as a team about our services and how we are supporting the business . Several of our services interact or have the potential to interact to provide greater value, and by supporting them all we can plan for this, and start to see links we might not have seen before. We can start thinking about how we could improve the support we provide to the organisation in the long term, not just over the timescale of an individual project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap, the most valuable of these to me are the team stability, the service stability, and the long-term strategy it enables at the team level. These are all enabled by having service teams that support a coherent set of services for their full life. Funding teams is a necessity to be able to provide this model, as you can‚Äôt be scraping together bits and pieces of project funding from different interested groups if you want to ensure you provide the most value to the whole organisation, and if you want to be able to provide long term support. The organisation needs to take the view that the services are for the long term, and support them as such, and not as individual projects that then get swallowed up somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I‚Äôve got my why post out, I will try to write something on how it works practically, which should be easier with this context to refer back to.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trying out gatsbyjs for a personal site]]></title><description><![CDATA[I've decided to create my own personal site, to keep my blog posts and personal projects together in one place.

&lt;p&gt;This gives me somewhere to keep my blog posts and my personal projects together, whilst giving me some practice with a technology new to me - gatsbyjs. I chose gatsby because I had heard several colleagues talking about it, and fancied giving it a go. I‚Äôm fairly surprised by how easily it has gone - I got as far as getting the starter I used personalised and deployed within a day, which included struggling with some build issues I had early on without my normal recourse to bothering developers at work for answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some bits I‚Äôve learned so far:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the issues I had early on were because I am terrible at reading fully through documentation before jumping in, and I hadn‚Äôt realised that if I change the graphql query in the gatsby-config file, you need to restart the development server before doing anything with it. This kept my builds failing for ages, and all kind of errors. However many times the developers I work with tell me I can fix anything by googling the error messages, I still usually give up too easily and ask them instead. Working on my own at the weekend, I couldn‚Äôt rely on them, and have realised I really can fix anything by googling. for ages. over and over. I‚Äôm quite pleased I managed to work this one out myself even if it took me most of a day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I had been planning on adding a CMS for managing future blog posts. I read up plenty on netlify CMS, but then realised that I‚Äôm pretty happy using markdown, and the way the pages are set up is pretty simple so for now I‚Äôm happy doing it this way. I may come back to this in the future, and would definitely add one if I had collaborators. Another thing I looked into was importing the posts I had already written from medium - there is a plugin that pulls from medium, but it just provides an overview, and not the full post. It looks like there is also an rss feed plugin which might do the job, but I decided to migrate wholesale once I realised I was happy to write future posts from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I will never cease to be amazed how long I can think something is properly broken before realising some bit of punctuation is in the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What I learned deploying my own react app]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently I built my own react app to learn more about react and get in some coding practice.

I am a delivery manager and don‚Äôt often get the chance to code day to day, so have set it as my learning and development objective. Once I had it written, I decided that learning to deploy something would be a good next step, as before I have just used github pages. A while ago a colleague recommended to me that when I was learning something new I write a blog post about it. It would help me remember and think through what I did, ensure that I fully understood what I had learned, and might help someone else trying to do the same thing. So this is that blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially followed &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@rksmith369/how-to-deploy-mern-stack-app-on-aws-ec2-with-ssl-nginx-the-right-way-e76c1a8cd6c6&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not going to rewrite the tutorial with the bits I did changed, as it is a good tutorial‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI am going to go through what I learned from the process, and what I ended up doing differently. The main aim for me was to understand what is going on, which a lot of tutorials don‚Äôt go in to‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey just want to get you to the end. I‚Äôve included links to all the things I read when trying to understand what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html&quot;&gt;EC2 instance&lt;/a&gt; as I have been trying to learn more about AWS, and felt working through an example would help me understand it better than just reading. This turned out to be the case, because although I had a conceptual idea of what an EC2 instance was, it wasn‚Äôt until I had &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.robertelder.org/what-is-ssh/&quot;&gt;SSHed&lt;/a&gt; into my instance and started installing things that it twigged that I was doing the same thing in a virtual computer as I did when I was running my app running locally. Setting up the instance I found very straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next steps were where I found myself diverging from the tutorial. I wanted to go very basic to start with so that I could follow what I was doing. Initially I just installed node and mongo, and didn‚Äôt follow the parts for nginx as I hadn‚Äôt used it before when running locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had to modify the npm install steps from the tutorial, as my app was set up with a different structure. This also meant that the line added right at the beginning of the tutorial for finding the build folder wasn‚Äôt quite right (rather than pointing it to client/build, I moved the build folder to the same place as the server.js file). The first time I tried to just run through the tutorial as written, this tripped me up and is why I decided to go back, strip out the bits I didn‚Äôt need/understand, and then add more complexity once I had the basics working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up mongo, I followed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.mongodb.com/master/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/?_ga=2.20588734.728762050.1508255237-190824932.1508255237#install-mongodb-community-edition&quot;&gt;documentation here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check it all worked, I then got my page running by manually doing the build step, transferring the build folder to where I wanted it, then running node server.js‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääonce I was happy with this I set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script&quot;&gt;shell script&lt;/a&gt; to do all the steps for me. These are the steps I used and why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git pull origin master; #to ensure the code I have is up to date
rm -rf coffee-tracker-backend/build; #removes any existing build folder from the backend directory
cd coffee-tracker-frontend;
npm install; # install in case any new front end deps have been included since last install
npm run build; #builds the frontend
cd ..;
cp -R coffee-tracker-frontend/build/ coffee-tracker-backend; #copies the build folder to the backend directory
cd coffee-tracker-backend;
npm install; # install in case any new back end deps have been included since last install
sudo node server; #starts up the backend&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all run from the main directory and sets off everything I was doing before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This didn‚Äôt all go quite as smoothly as I have made out‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI had a couple of issues with ports and the websockets I am using. With the ports, locally I had been running the front end on 3000, and the backend on 3001. I moved to using one port, but then had issues with my local firewall so ended up just using port 80. I then noticed that my sockets weren‚Äôt working, but found &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50411954/socket-io-connection-working-fine-in-localhost-but-not-when-deploying-on-heroku&quot;&gt;this answer which worked&lt;/a&gt;‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI have learned since that because http defaults to port 80, I only needed to specify the port for sockets.io when it was different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had not realised that when I exited out of my EC2 instance, the whole thing would stop. To fix this, I used the process manager mentioned in the original tutorial, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pm2.keymetrics.io/&quot;&gt;http://pm2.keymetrics.io/&lt;/a&gt; . This was much more simple than I expected to set up, and I switched the last step of my shell script to pm2 start server from node server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, on reflection, this was much easier than I had expected. I had built up deploying something myself to be really complicated, and I hadn‚Äôt realised that it was pretty much the same as running things locally, and that automating a bunch of steps was as straightforward as using a shell script.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Radarban Roadmap]]></title><description><![CDATA[The roadmaps I‚Äôve seen before have tended to be linear, and have dates.

&lt;p&gt;The roadmaps I‚Äôve seen before have tended to be linear, and have dates. This is the entire point in a roadmap for some people, but for me it is too restrictive if I am meant to be able to respond to changes and new priorities. Once you have a linear roadmap, people expect it to be followed and for things to turn up in exactly that order. This is even worse if there are dates on it, because they expect those things at exactly those times. (Again, this is probably why some people like them, but it doesn‚Äôt work if you are responding to what you are learning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, a roadmap is useful for a couple of things. One is supporting a conversation with stakeholders around priorities and for managing expectations. If I am to manage their expectations, putting exact dates on things a long time away is not the way to do it. For prioritisation, I‚Äôve written &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/the-anatomy-of-our-kanban-board&quot;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; about how I don‚Äôt find it useful to prioritise more than the next few items against each other‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbeyond these you can just group up priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roadmaps are also useful to support team communications. Having a shared idea of what is and isn‚Äôt in scope, somewhere to store features we have an idea about but haven‚Äôt yet elaborated into cards (and shouldn‚Äôt spend time on quite yet), something to support a conversation on the scope of current features, and what might need to be done ahead of certain tests and releases. None of this requires a linear roadmap, or dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When putting together my current roadmap, I had in mind the radarban board that &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@pauldambra&quot;&gt;Paul D‚ÄôAmbra&lt;/a&gt; showed at the Deliver Sessions last year. I liked that it allowed multiple items to share a space in time, and it constrained how many items would be the current top priority. It allowed for items to be prioritised against each other, and for things that wouldn‚Äôt happen for a while to have broadly the same priority so you didn‚Äôt have to worry too much about how they were positioned relative to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    
&lt;em&gt;Early roadmap for my current project using now/next/later to organise priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a very early version of my roadmap, which was trying to get all the bits and pieces that people were discussing visible, and sorted according to priority for delivery. It supported several things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several items were removed from it as people pointed out they were out of scope for the current work‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit made these differences in what people thought were in and out of scope visible so we could discuss them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several items were removed because of dependencies they had on other work going on ‚Äîwe will reintroduce them once they are possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items were moved about as we learned more talking to our users and our stakeholders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items were moved as we decided on what the minimum set of features could be for a small release&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By having a WIP limit (defined by the available space), conversations with stakeholders around the prioritisation of work and not everything being top priority were a bit easier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some deficiencies to it that I improved over time or would change in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the names are shorthand that the team understood, like ‚Äúproductionise core alpha features‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe knew what these were, but it isn‚Äôt a very clear block of work. I could have done with breaking that down a bit more to help communicate it outside the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have done with splitting some of the features into basic functionality of the feature we would do now/next, and extra functionality of those features that would be for later‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis would have helped the team more with understanding what the work in now/next covered, and manage stakeholder expectations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on in the project, we are starting to get nearer to the point where we decide what will be available for various users as we roll it out, and what we won‚Äôt do. I have been asked for more clarity on timelines, so despite my earlier reticence have added some indication of time. Now is the right time to do that, but I stand by not having it early on in delivery when timelines were unknown. This is the latest version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this supports stakeholders in understanding what features their user groups will have depending on when they come on board, and gives an idea of where we‚Äôve identified further user research is needed into needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sure it will continue to evolve, but I‚Äôm fairly happy with the radarban template as one way of roadmapping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Donald Rumsfeld estimating]]></title><description><![CDATA[For a long time, I have avoided estimation.

I‚Äôve generally found that story count and cycle time has served me well enough if I do need to provide forecasts, and I have only provided ‚Äòhow long might this particular feature take‚Äô forecasts, rather than ‚Äúwhen will I get all of this‚Äù forecasts of large numbers of features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my current work, I have a relatively well defined core set of needs that we want to meet for initial rounds of testing, and I want to have an idea of when the features will be ready so that we can plan in testing participants. This has given me reason to put some estimates to the work we are doing. I also needed to provide a rough date rather than a length of time for a single feature, so needed a consistent method to apply to all the stories that made up the core set of features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The usual method of estimating after enough analysis has been done to understand the card in detail doesn‚Äôt sit right with me.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis and design are still work that need to be done, which have an impact on how long it takes to deliver. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me to ignore this when providing estimates. The analysis and design take up most of the time for delivery, so just estimating development and test effort isn‚Äôt much use to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt want to do all the analysis and design up front, so it makes sense to provide estimates for all the work. This means my previous method of using story count wasn‚Äôt suitable as the stories were in a very early stage (pre analysis), and so highly variable in how well defined they are. By the time the cards are ready for development they have generally been broken down small enough to use story count, if an estimate was needed for that stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I estimate, I want to estimate early before any analysis and design work has started. Another benefit of this is that it helps the team understand where our really complex areas are, and where we have a lot of knowledge gaps. This can prompt us to do more research or testing in those areas if needed, or &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/balancing-long-term-vision&quot;&gt;do some concept designs earlier on to work out some ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I don‚Äôt want to spend lots of time estimating.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt get enough value out of estimating to spend lots of time doing it and discussing sizes. Normally the value in estimating is the conversation and building team knowledge of the requirement anyway, but as I want to estimate prior to analysis and we have robust 3 amigos sessions later on this loses value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don‚Äôt want the team getting side tracked during estimation, and coming up with solutions before we even get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I don‚Äôt want to think about days of work‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääonly complexity.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is what we are meant to do with estimates, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever sat in a session which hasn‚Äôt occasionally devolved into adding up days of work to come up with estimates. Given we will be estimating the full work from analysis to done, this isn‚Äôt sensible‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe uncertainty over time in days is possibly even worse for analysis and design work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing to the day the size of each card isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm trying to get at anyway‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI still believe over time the story points even out, I just want them to be slightly scaled by complexity given how much variation there is in how much we know about cards at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So how am I going to estimate in a super speedy way that only looks at complexity very early on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald Rumsfeld estimating&lt;/strong&gt;‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis the piece of work a known known, a known unknown, or an unknown unknown?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Donald Rumsfeld with assorted sized dogs and T shirts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of estimating work required to deliver value -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Known known&lt;/strong&gt;‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe know well what we want to do, there isn‚Äôt much analysis or design to do (maybe we are very happy with something from our prototype), and the developers know how they want to tackle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Known unknown&lt;/strong&gt;‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe still have some questions. Maybe there is a bit more analysis around how people use something, or the designers want to tweak something in response to earlier feedback, or the developers aren‚Äôt quite sure how to implement the feature. Basically though, we know what questions we need to ask before we are able to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknown unknown&lt;/strong&gt;‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe know something is needed, but not much more than that. We might not even be entirely certain it is needed. The developers have a lot of questions about what needs to be done. &lt;strong&gt;As soon as people start discussing what a card means or start debating what is needed we give it this estimate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Points points points.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be useful for estimating when we can book in our test participants, I need some points. At this stage, you could use Fibonacci or whatever your favourite numbers are. I like to use a 2 power series, with 4 for known known, 8 for known unknown, and 16 for unknown unknowns just because it goes up faster than the Fibonacci sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have these, it will take at least a month to start getting enough points delivered to make any sensible kind of forecast. I‚Äôve found it has taken about 2 months to get to a stage where the forecast isn‚Äôt fluctuating highly due to not enough data points. Right now it is remaining fairly consistent, and the measures of complexity do seem to be lining up with how long those features take to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Balancing long term vision with short term delivery priorities]]></title><description><![CDATA[I‚Äôve been thinking recently about how our team balances the effort we put in to putting together designs for the long term vision for our service, with the work we need to do now to deliver our minimum viable product and the private beta of our service.]]></description><link>https://eleanormollett.com/posts/balancing-long-term-vision/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://eleanormollett.com/posts/balancing-long-term-vision/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been thinking recently about how our team balances the effort we put in to putting together designs for the long term vision for our service, with the work we need to do now to deliver our minimum viable product and the private beta of our service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to be able to look forwards and think about where we want to go so we can communicate this to stakeholders and other services we interact with, to build engagement and to make sure we don‚Äôt back ourselves into a corner by focusing only on our immediate delivery. However, we also want to make sure we don‚Äôt start fixing problems before we verify they exist, and that we balance the effort we put into this with our delivery work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Balancing delivery and vision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things I wanted to take into account before adding longer term design work into the team backlog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How much do we want to do in advance?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having an idea of where we might go will help us understand what we don‚Äôt know yet, and what we need to validate before we go in to further detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However we have to be careful we don‚Äôt introduce and accept features without verifying the user need, and we want to make sure we are able and free to adapt to feedback we receive during our user testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We all have time constraints, and don‚Äôt want to neglect delivery priorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do we want to communicate the longer term design work with the whole team?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to engage with the whole team and inspire better ideas by sharing our work. By having a shared understanding of the vision and what others are working on, individuals can have more autonomy in how they work towards the goal rather than working away at individual tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, team members have previously indicated that they don‚Äôt want to expend too much effort or become distracted by getting too involved in work that isn‚Äôt immediately relevant to them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to make sure when we feedback the work, we don‚Äôt get stuck on details‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit will be a vision not a plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do we want to communicate the longer term design work to stakeholders?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing our longer term vision can help us build relationships with users, and helps them get involved and invested in the work we are doing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use this to recruit users to gather useful feedback on what does and doesn‚Äôt work for them, and validate the assumptions we are using&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This needs to be balanced with an understanding that these are long term ideas, and may never be realised. We need to be careful stakeholders understand the designs are concepts, and not exactly what they will get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How I will introduce the work to the backlog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to me that we track the work that is happening in the team (see &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/types-of-work&quot;&gt;this earlier post&lt;/a&gt;). To facilitate the work on longer term vision, I have introduced ‚Äòconcept cards‚Äô to our kanban board. These are very high level, looking at things that are further off in the road map, and will go straight to the design team. We have agreed on a work in progress limit of 1 card on the board at any time so that the work on these is balanced with delivery capacity. Ideas from these will inform the questions we ask and the testing we do. They will be concepts, not plans, and will be highly likely to change before they get to the delivery stage, based on greater understanding of user needs from testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To share the concepts with the team we are going to trial getting them up on the wall in the open, walking the team though them and then taking comments and questions on the concepts post-its to try to prevent us from discussing the details or implementation to closely, but this is a trial so we will continue to change this method based on how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very interested in how other teams manage this balance, if you have any suggestions or examples please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reducing time spent in queues]]></title><description><![CDATA[Many teams across DWP and government are now using kanban boards to visualise the work going on in their team.

However, this is only one part of kanban. Whilst it is an important first stage to map out the flow work takes to delivery, and to visualise what work the team has going on, the main value of kanban comes in using it to then improve the flow of your work. The way kanban does this is through limiting work in progress. It is the most important aspect of kanban, but it is often neglected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should we limit work in progress? Because we want to spend less time in queues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are generally two types of queues on a kanban board, the ‚Äúdone‚Äù queue in each column waiting to be picked up by the next stage, and the ‚Äúdoing‚Äù queue of partially done work. These queues cause several problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Increasing the time it takes to deliver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a work item is sitting in a queue waiting to be picked up, no work is happening on that item it is just sitting there. The longer the queue is, the longer it will be sitting there waiting. A task that might only take half a day could be sat in a queue for many days with other work ahead of it. If that item of work has to go through multiple queues as it works its way along the kanban board, these delays start to add up. An item of work that you estimate will only take a few days because each stage is short will take much longer due to the time taken waiting to be picked up by each stage. The users want the finished product and they want it quickly, it doesn‚Äôt matter how fast you can do each stage if in between it sits waiting in a queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my team we have found that work in progress limits encourage team members to help out elsewhere rather than adding to an internal queue. This speeds up the time it takes us to deliver partially completed work, rather than starting on new work and adding to our pile of partially done work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Don‚Äôt add to your personal queue until you finish!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work getting out of date&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst this work item is sitting in queues, it is also getting stale. Analysis might be out of date by the time the work comes to be coded, the code could be clashing with something else by the time it is released to live. The quicker the work item can get through the board, the less likely extra work will have to be done to it to get it ready again for release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because work in progress limits reduce the time between work getting started and being finished by reducing the length of each queue, the analysis and code has less time to go out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blockers don‚Äôt get removed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a long queue work to do and a blocker comes up on one of them, you are likely to move on to something else rather than focusing on getting it fixed. You will then come back to that piece of work to find nothing has been done about the blocker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work in progress limits focuses the team on removing blockers as it prevents them from working on anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Context switching increases the time it takes to complete a task&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The queue of partially done work needs to be kept short to prevent task switching. In each column, there will generally be a limited number of people who can do that work. If they have a long list of things they are working on, they will be switching between each of these items. Each time they drop one piece of work to pick up another, they need to spend time getting up to speed again. Again, a piece of work that should only take half a day will take much longer if you are working on other things at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal work in progress limits and a limit on the number of items available to pick up reduces time switching between tasks by focusing people on one or two tasks at a time. This is one that we can all try to apply, even if you aren‚Äôt working using a kanban board!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Low priority work gets stuck at partially done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long queues of partially done work often contain multiple items that have no work being done on them at all, and which keep getting deprioritised in favour of other things. These items will never get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have found that personal work in progress limits discourages people from starting low priority work unless they know they can get it done quickly before a higher priority piece of work comes along, and encourages it to be finished if it does get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve written a bit about how we limit our work in progress &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/the-anatomy-of-our-kanban-board&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In short, we limit work in progress both in each column on our kanban board, and for each person on the team. The work in progress limit on the columns helps with the flow of work through the system, rather than creating internal ‚Äúdone‚Äù queues. The work in progress limit on team members is to reduce switching between tasks, and to reduce queues of work forming for one person. Both types of limits focus attention on getting blockers removed, and getting work done and delivered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Types of work on our kanban board]]></title><description><![CDATA[One of the things that often gets discussed during our daily team stand up is whether a piece of work should be on our kanban board, and whether the work on the board accurately reflects what the team is working on.

To get the most out of kanban, we should be reflecting all the work the team is doing on the board so that we can ensure that the work in progress limits are having the right impact, and improving the flow of delivery. I‚Äôve been reflecting on this recently by comparing it to the types of work discussed in ‚ÄúThe Phoenix Project‚Äù by Gene Kim, and looking at how we reflect each of the different types of work. There are 4 types of work in the book, business projects, internal projects/IT operational projects, change and maintenance, and unplanned work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Business Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are our most obvious pieces of work, generally new features or functionality for our service. Because these are pre planned and scoped, work on these projects almost always makes it to the board. Sometimes we do find that people are working on bits of business projects without it being on the board. This tends to be analysis work prior to really getting started on the card, or because a card on the board is actually too vague and extra work is being lumped under it. The benefit of reducing work in progress has reduced the amount of analysis happening in advance. We are trying to get better at querying cards that look a bit big, and being proactive about breaking them down so that the work is correctly reflected. Generally though, this work is well visualised and tracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internal projects/IT operations projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the technical features required to enable the service to work such as infrastructure and security. Initially this was fairly badly visualised, with the developers having a good idea of what was needed and what they were working on, but this was not reflected on the board. This meant that we had little idea of what extra work was going on, leading to other pieces of work taking longer than expected. Part of the reason these pieces of work weren‚Äôt making it to the wall is that the product owner prioritises the cards based on user need. The tech work required often gets missed as it and its importance is not always understood by the product owner and delivery manager. To improve this we have ring fenced at least 20% of the priority backlog (the next 10 cards we will work on) to work from the tech backlog. The tech backlog is prioritised by the developers and technical architect, who select the work to go on the priority backlog as they understand best what the priority of this work is.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    
&lt;em&gt;Diagram showing how we prioritise our tech backlog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Change and maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes and maintenance are the third type of work. It is easy for these to end up getting worked on ahead of new functionality depending on the person asking for the change, and on the perceived size of the change. It is easy to get side-tracked working on lots of bits of ‚Äúoh, it will only take a few minutes, could you just change this wording/routing‚Äù from important stakeholders. We have generally been good about making sure these get properly added to the backlog and prioritised against new functionality rather than just picked up as we receive the request. This includes both obvious changes to the service which get added to the main backlog, and changes to the backend which get added to the tech backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unplanned work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last type of work is unplanned work. These are the things that you suddenly realise you need to do and haven‚Äôt planned for. Given we are doing fairly well now at visualising and prioritising our other work, it is this kind of work that is most likely to throw off the team and lead to planned work taking much longer than expected. The types of things that end up here are live service issues that require immediate attention. These are reduced by assigning enough time to preventative maintenance to ensure that we are not building up technical debt. They are also reduced by properly prioritising change requests, and communicating these priorities back to stakeholders to manage any ‚ÄúI want it and I want it now‚Äù types of change requests. Being able to point to the other work that is prioritised ahead of the request, and ask which ones are less important is very helpful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally I think PYCA are doing well at visualising the 4 types of work from ‚ÄúThe Phoenix Project‚Äù. The work that I think we miss is the project overhead work that people like the product owner and delivery manager works on. I generally don‚Äôt feel that the kanban board is the right place for this work, but it is good to keep an eye on it. At the moment we have a separate board for this work, but it is something that we continue to work on.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why we walk the wall rather than asking for individual updates]]></title><description><![CDATA[My team started out using the standard stand up format of answering the 3 questions; What did I do yesterday?, What will I be doing today?, What are my blockers?.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did I do yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will I be doing today?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are my blockers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fairly large team we started finding this to be very repetitive, with multiple team members working on one piece of work, descriptions of meetings attended unrelated to the project, and more time spent discussing early work due to the greater number of team members assigned to analysis. Worst of all, there would be work that had started, but no one was working on currently. Using the yesterday/today format, this wouldn‚Äôt get mentioned at the standup, and would disappear from view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an experiment we started ‚Äòwalking the wall‚Äô once a week. We have a large wall dedicated to our kanban board, which has on it cards describing all the work currently being worked on. Once a week we would switch to discussing the cards on the wall, from right to left during the standup. This started focusing attention on cards that appeared to have no one working on the work described, identifying them to be picked up again. Usually it turned out that we had needed input from someone outside the team, and after sending a request to them, the card had been forgotten as the person working on it had moved on to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We soon decided to use this method in every standup, as people were fairly sick of repeating each other with the work they had been collaborating on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By discussing the cards starting from the right hand side of the board in turn;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We focus on the question ‚Äúwhat do we need to do to get this released‚Äù rather than getting a status update of what each person was doing. Any card that is left hanging around with no one working on it is quickly identified, and a team member can pick it up to move it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get updates from multiple members of the team who might have been working on it in context, rather than waiting for each of them to provide their updated interspersed with updates about unrelated work. This has improved communication between team members, and prompted more discussion around what is required and what help is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People don‚Äôt lose focus as they may when going around the entire team (because they are thinking about what to say when it comes to their turn), and so catch the update on work that may be coming their way in a day or two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Here I go into further detail about how our board is set up and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Columns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The columns on our kanban board are based on the workflow that our features take to delivery. We have descriptions under each of these headings to identify what we are expecting to happen at each of these stages‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääidentify what it is we want to do, how we are going to do it, check if we are doing it the right way, doing it, and then is it good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We promote sitting cards where the activity best fits based on those descriptions, and not focusing on the job role required to do it. If a developer is doing some technical analysis of the deployment pipeline, this should be in the analysis column and not the development column. User researchers should be working with business analysts early on to identify what hypotheses we have with new features and then to design their research rather than having a prototyped feature chucked over the wall for them to test. The number of columns and the column headings has been iterated a few times already and continue to be improved to best reflect our working practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each column we have sub columns of in progress and done, so that we can indicate when a card can be picked up for the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The current layout of my kanban board&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The priority backlog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst there are a number of cards in our backlog at any time, the product owner only selects at most 10 to be on the priority backlog list. Prioritising any more than 10 in advance is a waste of time. These are displayed to the left of the kanban board, and any new work that is picked up by a team member should come from this list. We typically aim to have two backend tasks on this list, with the rest being up to the product owner to choose as they wish. The product owner will order these in order of priority from top to bottom to indicate what they would like worked on first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When picking up a new piece of work, each member of the team first checks if there is anything already on the board they could work on to move it further towards release. They should work from right to left, focusing first on the working closest to being released to avoid adding more started work and leaving other work unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each card is for a story, and we expect them to move through each column on the board. The card details the story title, and is just enough that everyone can get an understanding of what is involved if they read the board or attend stand-up. We do not need any of the detail about the card, as this is all held in jira. We include the number on the top right hand corner of the card so that we can easily find it in jira to get further detail. The information about who is working on the card, and if any blockers or defects on the card get stuck to it and will be covered later.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    
&lt;em&gt;The layout of a card on my board&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work in progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have work in progress (WIP) limits for each of the columns on the board. These ensure that we do not introduce internal queues for certain pieces of work to be completed, and focus the team on delivering completed features rather than mindlessly continuing to pick up more items to work on when other team members are overwhelmed. The work in progress limit applies to both the in progress and done work of a column, ensuring that work cannot pile up in ‚Äòdone‚Äô waiting for someone to pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a work in progress limit is breached, no more work can be started in that column, and team members wishing to do this work should do what they can to help reduce the queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WIP limits were initially set as a guess based on the number of developers, and have been tweaked a little. Analysis had ended up with a slightly higher limit, to reflect the fact that some features get analysed and then rapidly closed if it turns out the work is not a priority, or that it could be delivered elsewhere. This has recently been reduced in line with the other columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have some lovely green and red indicators to the top of each column to signal if the work in progress limit has been breached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Avatars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have avatars for each team members so that we can indicate who is working on each piece of work. This has the added benefit of quickly identifying any cards not being worked on by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The avatars are also used to limit work in progress further, by ensuring that not only are limits not breached within an area of work, but that each individual is not overwhelmed by work. As we have encouraged people to work across different delivery areas, having work in progress limits just on the work areas could still lead to individual team members being overworked across multiple different areas. This is not good for productivity or team health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each user has 2 avatars (recently reduced form 3), and is allowed to reduce this number at any time. They can also add more than one of their avatar to a piece of work if they feel that that is where their main focus lies. Some users have also reduced their number of available avatars by attaching them to ongoing jobs above the board, such as ‚Äúend of year HR stuff‚Äù which wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be on the kanban board as this focuses on feature delivery. This also helps indicate what kinds of things are taking up the teams time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swim lanes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have at some points had two swim lanes on our kanban board for work being done on similar projects that are being delivered to different customers. We started out having two separate boards for this, but due to the number of team members who had an input to both projects, and the dependencies between the two we have added them to the same board. This allowed us to keep track of the team capacity across both projects by having the work in progress limits cover both, ensure that we did not go over our capacity without realising it. It also allowed us to have flexible and sometimes uneven prioritisation of work across the two projects, and divert more resource to one project without having to adjust individual project WIP limits. We ended up merging the work into the same board when it became clear the swim lanes weren‚Äôt really adding anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We indicate when a defect has been identified with a feature using a defect sticker. This can be at any stage, but they typically appear in the user testing and quality assurance columns. These stickers allow us to do the work to fix the defect in the column where the defect was identified rather than moving the card back to the left to the column where the work needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that we prioritise our work based on what is closest to release, and we identify this as being the cards nearest to the right hand side of the board. By moving the card to the left, we would in effect be deprioritising the card. In reality, the opposite needs to happen and the priority to fix the defect needs to come ahead of other work to be done in that earlier stage. For example, if a defect is identified in quality assurance, the fix for this in development should be prioritised ahead of working on other cards in development, and certainly ahead of picking up new cards for development from the done column of user testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blockers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to the defects, we identify blockers with a sticker. We still discuss these cards in each standup, and focus on what needs to be done to remove the blocker. These cards are still included in work in progress limits, to ensure that the pressure is kept up to remove the blocker. We have started recording the reasons that blocker cards get added so that we can spot any trends developing, and address these in our retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set up has worked well for us in delivering and improving a service whilst rolling out to new sites, and will probably continue to work well for us as we move into live service and support. I am currently working on a layout that will work better for us with the initial discovery for a project, when we are still feeling out what our problem space is, and what our options might be. I‚Äôm sure once I have a better idea of what form it will take it will feature in a blog post. For now it has taken over a large wall and involves string.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why my team uses kanban]]></title><description><![CDATA[Using kanban has improved our visibility of what work is being done by the team, and prevented each stage of work on a feature from becoming uncoupled from each other.]]></description><link>https://eleanormollett.com/posts/why-my-team-uses-kanban/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://eleanormollett.com/posts/why-my-team-uses-kanban/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Back in October, my team was using scrum to deliver our service. Our service is relatively simple technologically, but requires a lot of analysis of policy and law, good content design, and thorough user research. Using scrum we found this work was either lumped outside of the sprints as product backlog refinement, or if it was included in the sprint we found user stories were being split according to the work to be done on it due to the work required (eg analyse and design feature X, do user research on feature X, develop feature X) so that they could be spread over sprints.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using kanban has improved our visibility of what work is being done by the team, and prevented each stage of work on a feature from becoming uncoupled from each other. We have columns for the activities that need to happen for each story, and the majority of stories should move through every stage towards release. Visualising this flow has helped us to identify where bottlenecks in our delivery process are, and focus on improving the flow through these points. It has also improved our focus on delivering features rather than starting more and more analysis work, as we center our attention in each stand up on what has to be done to the cards to get them in a state to be released starting from the right hand side of the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having work in progress limits has helped with the focus on delivery rather than starting new work. Each area of work has a work in progress limit, and this applies to work in that areas done column. If the next stage to delivery is overloaded and so isn‚Äôt picking up work, earlier stages quickly fill their WIP limits and are prevented from taking on more work. They have to do what they can to get cards completed and unblock the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also used kanban to try to break down some of the silos that form between team members with different job roles. We have moved away from naming the work columns after job titles, and make them more descriptive of the activities happening. We are starting to recognise that much of the work each of us does, does not fit neatly into one column, and that we can provide value to the development of a feature throughout the delivery pipeline, rather than working to try and clear each story card from our inbox never to be seen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, using kanban has supported our team in working on two separate streams of work (both related to the same project). We are able to easily visualise the dependencies between the two streams of work, and prioritise work unevenly across the two projects if needed, whilst keeping track of the teams capacity and ensuring total work in progress continues to be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flexibility of kanban has suited our team and the service we are providing during delivery. It has supported our sometimes rapidly changing priorities, improved team communication and collaboration, and provided much better visibility of our work and where in our workflow we can target for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
