# Personal site using lumen
This is my personal site, which has my blog posts about delivery, some delivery artifacts I use regularly, and links to some of my projects. I have used the [Lumen starter](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) from [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) for this as it was a quick way to come up with a nice looking site when I wanted to move away from hosting my posts on Medium.

## Getting Started
If you want to use the same starter, you can install it (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
`gatsby new lumen https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-v2-starter-lumen`

#### Running in Development
`gatsby develop`

#### Building
`gatsby build`
