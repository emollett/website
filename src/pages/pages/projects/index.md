##Coffee Tracker
A site for tracking the coffee purchasing of my team. Coffee is input with info about who bought it and when, when it was opened, and if people particularly liked it. In future I might do something with the date opened data, but for now it just tracks who bought the packs. This was my first react project, and first project trying to deploy something myself.

##[Meeting Calculator](https://emollett.github.io/meeting-value/index)
This calculates the cost of a meeting by multiplying the average day rate of the attendees by the number of them present.

The timer can be paused and reset, and if you need to hide the day rate, check the button after entering the information. Checking the box can be done before or after the timer starts, the day rate information can be seen again by clicking the check-box again.

I created this after sitting in several very large very long meetings wondering how much it was all costing us. At the time I was doing code practice on codewars, but hadn't quite worked out how the code I was writing there translated to something I could see and interact with, so I created this to test out what I had learned.

##[Calendar Creator](https://emollett.github.io/calendar/calendar)

A very basic site for generating blank calendars to use in planning - you can choose the start date, how many weeks you want, and if you want weekends or not. It then generates a grid with the dates in them that you can print out to sketch out projects or whatever else.
